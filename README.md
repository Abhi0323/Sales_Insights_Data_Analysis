Sales Insights: Empowering Data-Driven Business Decisions with Power BI, SQL, and Excel.


I worked on a project called Sales Insights that involved utilizing the analytical capabilities of Power BI, SQL, and Excel to gain insights from sales data. The project provides a comprehensive solution for businesses seeking to gain a competitive edge through data-driven decision-making.

Project Overview

Data Cleaning and Exploration using Excel and SQL
Visualization using Power BI

Data Cleaning and Exploration using Excel and SQL:

The first component of the project involved me cleaning and exploring the data using Excel and SQL. Using Excel, I applied various functions and formulas to explore and clean the data, such as removing duplicates, filtering, sorting, and fixing data errors.

After exploring and cleaning the data in Excel, I imported the data into SQL to perform further data transformation and aggregation. I used SQL queries to transform the data into a more structured format that could be used for analysis.

Visualization using Power BI:

The second component of the project involved me creating interactive visualizations using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool that enabled me to create stunning and interactive visualizations that made it easy to understand the data.

The dashboards created with Power BI include revenue by year, revenue over time, top sales by customers, profits in different years, and many other visualizations that provide insights into the sales data.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Sales Insights is an exceptional project that showcases my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization. It demonstrates how I leveraged the power of Power BI, SQL, and Excel to gain valuable insights from sales data. This project is a great example of how businesses can use data to make informed decisions and gain a competitive advantage.
